# 🌐 Stage 2 Task — Contact & About Me Pages

This project is part of my Frontend Development learning journey. It features two responsive web pages built with semantic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — a **Contact Me** page with form validation and an **About Me** page showcasing personal reflections and goals.
